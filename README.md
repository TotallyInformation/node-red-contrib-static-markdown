# node-red-contrib-staticMarkdown
Serve up a folder of static markdown files from Node-RED

In the admin panel for the node instance, provide a url path and a source folder.

The source folder can contain sub-folders. Files with an extension of `.md` will be served as web pages.

Each folder may contain a file named `index.md` and if so, this will be used as the default page for that folder.

## Markup

The source files can contain any valid CommonMark markup and may also contain metadata in a YAML header. e.g.

```
---
title: This is the title for my markdown file
---
# My markdown file

This file will be served as HTML with the help of Node-RED.
```

## Templates

The source files folder may contain a sub-folder named `.templates`. If it does, it should contain a Handlebars template called `default.hba`.

If the `.templates` folder does not exist, a default template will be used.
